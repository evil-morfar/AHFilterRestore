# Auction House Filter Restore

*A simple addon that restores your previous set filter in the auction house.*

Tired of the auction house filter resetting every time you close the auction house or switches tabs? Then this addon is for you! It simply restores your filter every time you land on the main auction house tab, effectively making it permanent (until you reset it, that is). That's it - no more, no less.
